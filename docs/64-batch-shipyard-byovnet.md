# Virtual Networks and Batch Shipyard
The focus of this article is to explain how to bring your own Virtual Network
with Batch Shipyard. This will allow you to deploy Batch compute nodes
into a subnet within the Virtual Network that you specify.

## Batch Account Modes, Configuration and Settings
The following sections will describe the different account modes along with
configuration and settings to enable you to deploy Batch compute nodes to
an existing Virtual Network.

### Choose Your Batch Account Mode
You can bring your own virtual network with either Batch Service and
User Subscription Batch accounts. Outside of management of the resources
deployed to the subnets, there is no difference in Batch-level functionality.
However, it may be more convenient or compliant to use one mode over the
other.

### Azure Active Directory Authentication Required
Azure Active Directory authentication is required for the `batch` account
regardless of the account mode. This means that the
[credentials configuration file](11-batch-shipyard-configuration-credentials.md)
must include an `aad` section with the appropriate options, including the
authentication method of your choosing.

Your service principal requires at least the `Virtual Machine Contributor`
role permission or a
[custom role with the action](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-custom-roles):

* `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

## `virtual_network` Pool configuration
To deploy Batch compute nodes into a subnet within a Virtual Network that
you specify, you will need to define the `virtual_network` property in the
pool configuration file. The template is:

```yaml
  virtual_network:
    arm_subnet_id: /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<virtual_network_name>/subnets/<subnet_name>
    name: myvnet
    resource_group: resource-group-of-vnet
    create_nonexistant: false
    address_space: 10.0.0.0/16
    subnet:
      name: subnet-for-batch-vms
      address_prefix: 10.0.0.0/20
```

If you specify an `arm_subnet_id`, then all other options within
the `virtual_network` property are ignored. Ensure that the `arm_subnet_id`
includes the subnet postfix of the virtual network resource id. **Your Batch
account must reside within the same subscription and region as the Virtual
Network.**

If you do not specify an `arm_subnet_id`, then you will need to specify
the individual components of the Virtual Network and Subnet in the other
properties. You can also allow Batch Shipyard to create the Virtual Network
on your behalf.

**Note:** It is recommended to deploy Batch compute nodes in their own
exclusive subnet.

If you provide `management` credentials, then Batch Shipyard will
automatically validate that the subnet has enough logical IP address space
to fit the desired number of target dedicated and low priority compute nodes.
Note that this calculation does not consider autoscale where the number of
nodes can exceed the specified targets.

## Network Security
Azure provides a resource called a Network Security Group that allows you
to define security rules to restrict inbound and outbound network traffic
on to the associated resources. A Network Security Group can be attached
to one more resources and more than one Network Security Group can work
in concert with another Network Security Group operating on a different
set of resources within the deployment.

When specifying your own Virtual Network for Batch compute nodes to deploy
into, Azure Batch does not modify or create a Network Security Group at the
Virtual Network level (associated with subnets). Instead, Azure Batch creates
necessary Network Security Groups and attaches them to the individual
Network Interfaces for each VM instance within a VM ScaleSet. The Network
Security Group that Batch creates will deny any external IP traffic bound for
the two required open ports on Azure Batch Virtual Machine configuration
compute nodes (the node types used by Batch Shipyard) except for packets
originating from the Azure Batch service. Therefore, any external traffic
that is routed by the load balancer to the backend NAT pool of virtual
machines will be ultimately filtered by this Network Security Group bound for
the two required ports.

### Network Security Group on the Virtual Network
If you have specified a Network Security Group on the Virtual Network, then
you will need to create a single `Inbound Security Rule` to allow traffic
in at the Virtual Network level for Batch compute nodes to successfully
operate.

Ports `29876` and `29877` must allow `TCP` traffic from any source to any
destination as shown below:

![64-byovnet-nsg-inbound-rule.png](https://azurebatchshipyard.blob.core.windows.net/github/64-byovnet-nsg-inbound-rule.png)

Note that in the aforementioned Network Security, external traffic not
originating from the Azure Batch service will be dropped by the Network
Security Group Azure Batch deploys on each compute node network interface.

If you wish to apply additional inbound security rules for the remote access
port (i.e., `SSH`), then you can create an another `Inbound Security Rule`
with the destination port range to be `22` and protocol of `TCP`. The source
IP address space can be whatever your situation requires. You can even
create a deny rule for this port if you do not want to expose this port and
do not want to configure a software firewall.

**Note:** Batch compute nodes must be able to communicate with Azure Storage
servers. If you are restricting outbound network traffic through the Network
Security Group, please ensure that oubound `TCP` traffic is allowed on port
`443` for HTTPS connections. If you are using `Destination Service Tags` to
restrict outbound network traffic, ensure that you have either the generic
`Storage` service tag or the correct `Storage.<region>` service tag.
Additionally, ensure that if you are specifying the destination port that
you provide sufficient rules to cover all outbound requests over port `443`
including potentially accesses to other storage regions or any application
logic that may use port `443`.
